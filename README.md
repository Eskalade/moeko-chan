# Moeko-chan 🎵

Moeko-chan is a cute desktop companion that lives on your screen and vibes to your music in real-time. Using advanced audio analysis, Moeko-chan detects the BPM, mood, and energy of whatever you're listening to, changing her expressions and dance moves to match your flow.

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Immersive Desktop Spirit** – Moeko-chan floats on your desktop as a transparent, always-on-top widget. She sits above your code, your games, and your browser!
- **🧠 Intelligent Mood Sync** – Using real-time ML heuristics, Moeko-chan transitions between 5 distinct moods: **Chill, Energetic, Happy, Sad,** and **Sleep**.
- **🥁 Custom BPM Engine** – Built with a high-accuracy bass-isolation filter. By ignoring vocals and melodies, Moeko-chan "hears" the kick drum, ensuring her bounces are perfectly in sync with the beat.
- **💤 Signature Sleep Mode** – If the room goes quiet for more than 5 seconds, Moeko-chan will close her eyes and drift into a slow breathing animation until the music starts again.
- **👁️ Immersive Mode** – Press `Ctrl + L` to hide all UI buttons and her background glow. Moeko-chan becomes a clean, floating sticker on your screen for maximum cuteness.
- **✨ Physics-Based Animation** – Moeko-chan uses spring physics for her bops and squashes, making her feel soft, squishy, and alive.
